# Introduction of VISE.
-----------------------

First-principles calculations are becoming increasingly prevalent in materials science.
However, preparing input files for the calculations, handling calculations, and analyzing results are 
still not an easy task for researchers other than experienced ones.
To overcome the situation, we have developed VISE, meaning the vasp integrate simulation environment.
This VISE package supports VASP users to generate VASP input files for several tasks with suitable defaults.






**Note: Units used in pydefect are eV for energy and <span>&#8491;</span> for length following the vasp convention.**
