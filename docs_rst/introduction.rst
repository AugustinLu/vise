Introduction of vise.
=====================

First-principles calculations are becoming increasingly prevalent in materials science.
However, preparing input files for the calculations and analyzing calculation
results are still not an easy task for researchers other than experienced ones.
To overcome the situation, we have developed :code:`vise` code,
which means *vasp integrate simulation environment*.
:code:`Vise` supports :code:`VASP` users to generate its input files
for several tasks with suitable defaults, and allows the users to
tune some parameters depending on their particular purposes.

**Note: Units used in vise are eV for energy and angstrom for length
following the vasp convention.**
